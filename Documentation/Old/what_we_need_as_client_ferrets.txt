For the fragment "Team Scoreboard" we need a Http get() method. It should return all 
values that are needed to fill the Team Scoreboard fragment:

-getTeamScoreBoard (bzw getFacultyStats):
		returns: 
			Success: 
				a JSON Object:
					faculties: Faculty[]
					Faculty:
						id:Integer
						score:integer
						players_registered: integer
						players_active: integer
						players_dead: integer
					topPlayers: Players[10]
						facebookID:???
						name:String

For the "Statistics" Fragment we need a Http get() method. It should return all 
values that are needed to fill the Statistics fragment: 

-getUserStats:
		returns: 
			Success: 
				a JSON Object:
					playtime: Playtime:	hours:integer
								minutes:integer
					score:integer
					kills:integer //number of kills the user has assisted at
					deaths:integer
					captures:integer //number of flag captures the user has assisted at
					faculty:integer
					polygons:integer //number of polygons the user has drawn


PUSH MESSAGES
Ideally, whenever a flag changes or perhaps also when a player loses HP, we could send Push messages to the respective players (or all players for the flags)? I think we could evaluate them.
Dunno how plausible it is for flags, might be more performant through polling, but the HP would make sense that way.
